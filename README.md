# SQL_Pracetice_with_Apple_dataset
This project showcases my SQL practice using the Apple Store dataset. Through this project, I've worked on various SQL queries and analyses using real-world data from the Apple App Store. It's a way for me to improve my SQL skills.

The Apple Store dataset contains valuable information about various mobile apps available on the Apple App Store, including details such as app ratings, prices, genres, and more. Through this SQL practice, it allowed me to to perform a wide range of SQL queries, analyze the dataset, and gain insights into the mobile app market.

Special thanks to the YouTube channel "Lore So What" for providing valuable instructions and guidance throughout this project. Their tutorials and explanations were instrumental in helping me learn and complete this practice effectively.
